# Releases and versioning

Commits are how *you* track change; a **version** is how your *consumers* track it. The moment anything else depends on your code — another team, a published package, a deployed client — "latest on main" stops being a sufficient answer to "what am I running, and is it safe to upgrade?" A version number and a changelog are the contract that answers it.

## Semantic Versioning

For anything with consumers, version `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` and let the number carry meaning:

```
  MAJOR  breaking change — consumers must change their code to upgrade
  MINOR  new functionality, backward-compatible — safe to upgrade
  PATCH  bug fix, backward-compatible — safe to upgrade
```

The number is a promise, so make the code match it. A "patch" that changes behavior consumers relied on is a major change wearing a disguise. When unsure whether a change is breaking, assume it is or ask; a surprise major is far cheaper than a broken consumer.

## Tag the release, and let the tag be the source of truth

A release is an immutable point in history, not a moving branch. Tag it so it can always be reproduced:

```bash
git tag -a v1.4.0 -m "v1.4.0"
git push origin v1.4.0
```

Derive the version from the tag rather than hand-editing it in scattered files, so the artifact, the tag, and the changelog can never disagree.
