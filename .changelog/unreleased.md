<!--
Release notes for the next release. Add a line in the SAME commit that makes the
change. At a release the line moves into CHANGELOG.md and this file is emptied
again (docs/agents/releases.md).

What goes in: a change a user or the operator of the Home Assistant app can see
or feel. Not tests, CI, scripts, docs, lint fixes, refactorings without effect.
Reverted before the release? Delete the line. A bug that arose after the last
release gets no line, because no user has seen it. To tell the two apart, run
`git tag --contains <sha>` on the commit that caused the bug: an empty result
means no release carries it.

How to write it: one line, German, in the words of the user interface. Name what
changed for the user, not how it was built. Add "(#123)" when an issue drove the
change. Under "Fehlerkorrekturen" write what works now and name what went wrong
before, so a reader knows the bug.

Sections:
- Neue Funktionen: something that did not exist before.
- Verbesserungen: something existing gets better or more convenient.
- Fehlerkorrekturen: something went wrong and works now.
- Wartung: what the operator must know when updating: Go version, base image,
  environment variables, ports, data paths, migrations, security updates. The
  dependency updates of Dependabot are ONE line, added at the release, not one
  per update.

Keep every section, an empty one included. Do not change the headings.
